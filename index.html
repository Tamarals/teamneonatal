	<h2>About</h2>
	
	<p>"Neonatal nurse practitioners (NNP) are advanced practice nurses that care for premature and sick newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), emergency rooms, delivery rooms, or specialty clinics. Since NNPs care for neonates in need of constant attention, they often serve as primary caregivers to premature or ill newborns. A neonate under the care of an NNP may need specific, focused care due to premature birth, low birth weight, respiratory distress, heart abnormalities, congenital abnormalities, and other disorders."(How to Become a Neonatal Nurse Practitioner.)</p>
	<h2>STEPS to become a NNP</h2>
	<P>A neonatal nurse must be a registered nurse (RN) with a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree (BSN).You must be certified in Neonatal Resuscitation and/or Neonatal Intensive Care Nursing.
	You may also be required to complete a minimum number of years of clinical experience in a hospital setting.To become a neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP), you will also need a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree. Many neonatal nursing schools offer this degree through a two-year Advanced Practice Neonatal Nursing (APNN) program. This type of program will prepare you for nursing licensure as a nurse practitioner (NP) and/or clinical nurse specialist (CNS).</P>
